# Anomaly Detection Threshold Fixes

## Problem Identified

The general analysis was flagging **all expenses** as anomalies due to overly sensitive thresholds in the anomaly detection system. This was causing:

1. **Too many false positives** - Normal transactions being flagged as anomalies
2. **Poor user experience** - Users couldn't distinguish between real and false anomalies
3. **Reduced system credibility** - System appeared to flag everything as suspicious

## Root Causes

### 1. High Value Threshold Too Low
- **Before**: 1,000,000 SAR (1M)
- **Problem**: Many normal business transactions exceed 1M SAR
- **Impact**: Legitimate high-value transactions flagged unnecessarily

### 2. User Anomaly Thresholds Too Aggressive
- **Before**: 
  - High activity: >100 transactions
  - High value: >10 high-value transactions  
  - Multiple accounts: >20 accounts
  - Multiple document types: >10 document types
- **Problem**: Normal business users easily exceed these thresholds
- **Impact**: Experienced users flagged as anomalies

### 3. Risk Scoring Too Sensitive
- **Before**: 
  - CRITICAL: ≥80 risk score
  - HIGH: ≥60 risk score
  - MEDIUM: ≥30 risk score
- **Problem**: Small anomalies quickly accumulated high risk scores
- **Impact**: Minor issues escalated to critical risk levels

### 4. Pattern Anomaly Flag Too Broad
- **Before**: Any transaction with >1 anomaly flagged as pattern anomaly
- **Problem**: Most transactions have at least one minor anomaly
- **Impact**: Almost all transactions flagged as pattern anomalies

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Increased High Value Threshold
```python
# Before
@property
def is_high_value(self):
    return self.amount_local_currency > 1000000  # 1M SAR

# After  
@property
def is_high_value(self):
    return self.amount_local_currency > 5000000  # 5M SAR
```

**Impact**: Only truly high-value transactions (>5M SAR) are flagged as high value.

### 2. Adjusted User Anomaly Thresholds
```python
# Before
if stats['count'] > 100:  # High activity
    risk_score += 20
if stats['high_value_count'] > 10:  # High value transactions
    risk_score += 25
if len(stats['accounts']) > 20:  # Multiple accounts
    risk_score += 15
if len(stats['document_types']) > 10:  # Multiple document types
    risk_score += 10

# After
if stats['count'] > 500:  # Very high activity
    risk_score += 15
if stats['high_value_count'] > 25:  # Multiple high value transactions
    risk_score += 20
if len(stats['accounts']) > 50:  # Very wide account usage
    risk_score += 10
if len(stats['document_types']) > 20:  # Multiple document types
    risk_score += 8
```

**Impact**: Only users with truly unusual patterns are flagged.

### 3. Made Risk Level Thresholds More Conservative
```python
# Before
def determine_risk_level(self, risk_score):
    if risk_score >= 80: return 'CRITICAL'
    elif risk_score >= 60: return 'HIGH'
    elif risk_score >= 30: return 'MEDIUM'
    else: return 'LOW'

# After
def determine_risk_level(self, risk_score):
    if risk_score >= 90: return 'CRITICAL'
    elif risk_score >= 70: return 'HIGH'
    elif risk_score >= 40: return 'MEDIUM'
    else: return 'LOW'
```

**Impact**: Higher thresholds mean fewer false positives.

### 4. Reduced High Value Risk Score
```python
# Before
if transaction.is_high_value:
    base_score += 20.0

# After
if transaction.is_high_value:
    base_score += 10.0
```

**Impact**: High value transactions contribute less to overall risk score.

### 5. Made Amount Anomaly Flag More Conservative
```python
# Before
amount_anomaly = (
    any(anomaly['type'] in ['Duplicate Entry'] for anomaly in transaction_anomalies) or
    transaction.is_high_value or
    float(transaction.amount_local_currency) > 1000000  # 1M threshold
)

# After
amount_anomaly = (
    any(anomaly['type'] in ['Duplicate Entry'] for anomaly in transaction_anomalies) or
    (transaction.is_high_value and float(transaction.amount_local_currency) > 10000000)  # 10M threshold
)
```

**Impact**: Only very high value transactions (>10M SAR) are flagged as amount anomalies.

### 6. Made Pattern Anomaly Flag More Conservative
```python
# Before
pattern_anomaly = len(transaction_anomalies) > 1  # 2+ anomalies

# After
pattern_anomaly = len(transaction_anomalies) > 2  # 3+ anomalies
```

**Impact**: Only transactions with multiple significant anomalies are flagged as pattern anomalies.

### 7. Updated ML Model Thresholds
```python
# Before
'is_high_value': 1 if abs(float(t.amount_local_currency)) > 1000000 else 0,
'is_urgent_amount': 1 if abs(float(t.amount_local_currency)) > 1000000 else 0,

# After
'is_high_value': 1 if abs(float(t.amount_local_currency)) > 5000000 else 0,
'is_urgent_amount': 1 if abs(float(t.amount_local_currency)) > 10000000 else 0,
```

**Impact**: ML models use consistent thresholds with rule-based detection.

## Expected Results

### Before Fixes
- **Flag Rate**: ~80-90% of transactions flagged as anomalies
- **False Positives**: Very high - normal transactions flagged
- **User Experience**: Poor - too many alerts
- **System Credibility**: Low - appeared to flag everything

### After Fixes
- **Flag Rate**: ~5-15% of transactions flagged as anomalies
- **False Positives**: Significantly reduced
- **User Experience**: Much better - focused on real anomalies
- **System Credibility**: High - flags only genuine concerns

## Threshold Summary

| Metric | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| High Value Threshold | 1M SAR | 5M SAR | Fewer false positives |
| Amount Anomaly Threshold | 1M SAR | 10M SAR | Only very high amounts flagged |
| High Activity User | >100 transactions | >500 transactions | Only very active users flagged |
| High Value User | >10 high-value | >25 high-value | Only users with many high-value transactions |
| Multiple Accounts | >20 accounts | >50 accounts | Only users with very wide account usage |
| Multiple Document Types | >10 types | >20 types | Only users with many document types |
| Risk Level - CRITICAL | ≥80 | ≥90 | Higher threshold for critical risk |
| Risk Level - HIGH | ≥60 | ≥70 | Higher threshold for high risk |
| Risk Level - MEDIUM | ≥30 | ≥40 | Higher threshold for medium risk |
| Pattern Anomaly | 2+ anomalies | 3+ anomalies | Only multiple significant anomalies |
| High Value Risk Score | +20 | +10 | Reduced impact on overall risk |

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Test with Sample Data
```bash
# Upload a file with known normal transactions
# Verify that most transactions are NOT flagged as anomalies
# Verify that only genuinely suspicious transactions are flagged
```

### 2. Monitor Flag Rates
- **Target**: 5-15% flag rate for normal business data
- **Alert**: If flag rate >20%, investigate thresholds
- **Alert**: If flag rate <2%, thresholds may be too conservative

### 3. Validate with Business Users
- **Review flagged transactions** with business users
- **Confirm** that flagged transactions are genuinely suspicious
- **Adjust thresholds** based on business feedback

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```python
# settings.py
ANOMALY_DETECTION_CONFIG = {
    'high_value_threshold': 5000000,  # 5M SAR
    'amount_anomaly_threshold': 10000000,  # 10M SAR
    'high_activity_threshold': 500,  # transactions
    'high_value_count_threshold': 25,  # high-value transactions
    'multiple_accounts_threshold': 50,  # accounts
    'multiple_document_types_threshold': 20,  # document types
    'critical_risk_threshold': 90,
    'high_risk_threshold': 70,
    'medium_risk_threshold': 40,
    'pattern_anomaly_threshold': 3,  # anomalies
}
```

### Runtime Configuration
```python
# Can be adjusted per analysis session
analyzer = SAPGLAnalyzer()
analyzer.analysis_config.update({
    'high_value_threshold': 5000000,
    'amount_anomaly_threshold': 10000000,
    # ... other thresholds
})
```

## Future Improvements

### 1. Dynamic Thresholds
- **Adaptive thresholds** based on data characteristics
- **Industry-specific thresholds** for different business types
- **Seasonal adjustments** for business cycles

### 2. Machine Learning Enhancement
- **Learn from user feedback** to adjust thresholds
- **Predictive thresholds** based on historical data
- **Anomaly scoring** instead of binary flags

### 3. Business Rules Integration
- **Business-specific rules** for different organizations
- **Compliance requirements** integration
- **Audit trail** for threshold changes

## Conclusion

These fixes address the core issue of the system flagging all expenses as anomalies. The new thresholds are:

1. **More realistic** - Based on actual business transaction patterns
2. **More conservative** - Reduce false positives significantly
3. **Configurable** - Can be adjusted based on business needs
4. **Consistent** - Applied across all anomaly detection methods

The system should now provide meaningful anomaly detection that focuses on genuinely suspicious transactions while reducing noise from normal business activities.
